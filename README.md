# Haeinsa

Haeinsa is linearly scalable multi-row, multi-table transaction library for HBase.
Haeinsa uses two-phase locking and optimistic concurrency control for implementing transaction.
The isolation level of transaction is serializable.

## Features

Please see Haeinsa [Wiki] for further information.

- **ACID**: Provides multi-row, multi-table transaction with full ACID senantics.
- **[Linearly scalable]**: Can linearly scale out throughput of transaction as scale out your HBase cluster.
- **[Serializability]**: Provide isolation level of serializability.
- **[Low overhead]**: Relatively low overhead compared to other comparable libraries.
- **Fault-tolerant**: Haeinsa is fault-tolerant against both client and HBase failures.
- **[Easy migration]**: Add transaction feature to your own HBase cluster without any change in HBase cluster except adding lock column family.
- **[Used in practice]**: Haeinsa is used in real service.

## Usage

APIs of Haeinsa is really similar to APIs of HBase. Please see [How to Use] and [API Usage] document for further information.

	HaeinsaTransactionManager tm = new HaeinsaTransactionManager(tablePool);
	HaeinsaTableIface table = tablePool.getTable("test");
	byte[] family = Bytes.toBytes("data");
	byte[] qualifier = Bytes.toBytes("status");

	HaeinsaTransaction tx = tm.begin(); // start transaction

	HaeinsaPut put1 = new HaeinsaPut(Bytes.toBytes("user1"));
	put1.add(family, qualifier, Bytes.toBytes("Hello World!"));
	table.put(tx, put1);

	HaeinsaPut put2 = new HaeinsaPut(Bytes.toBytes("user2"));
	put2.add(family, qualifier, Bytes.toBytes("Linearly Scalable!"));
	table.put(tx, put2);

	tx.commit(); // commit transaction to HBase
